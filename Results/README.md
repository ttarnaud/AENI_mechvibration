#File explanation
SC: strength curves
all: all simulation sets see ppt (4 head models, 2 locations, 3 layer sizes)
cEG: results obtained with calcErrorGrid function
kAus: simulation of aritificial field defined by a spatial contstant kAus (Aus= amplitude Ultrasound)
nos4l: field distribution is not defined by s4l
a2PiCondBug: after 2pi correction of conductivity. conductivity of air layer was incorrect. Forgot 2pi for imaginairy part. Other simulations should not be affected because are ran without frequency dependence.
Amp_fkApdpset: Search for required vibration amplitude. fkApdpset = fixed kAus per dipole set
